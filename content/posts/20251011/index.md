This will be another "Local Woods" guitar with all species of wood used being native to North America, and some locally harvested from Alabama.

### Neck / Cental Core
Thee-ply laminate (vertical) of Cherry / Walnut / Cherry.
 - Cherry _([Prunus serotina](https://www.wood-database.com/black-cherry/))_
 - Walnut _([Juglans nigra](https://www.wood-database.com/black-walnut/))_

### Body
Another three-ply laminate (horizontal) of Curly Maple, Cherry, and Curly Maple.
 - Curly Maple _([Acer sp.](https://www.wood-database.com/curly-maple/))_

I am not sure the exact species of the piece that I have but I suspect it is Big Leaf _([Acer macrophyllum](https://www.wood-database.com/bigleaf-maple/))_.


### Fretboard
Still have not fully committed yet.  I am thinking Walnut, but also considering using the last piece of Persimmon that I have.  The Walnut will look good being dark, but I am concerned about the long term durability.  The Persimmon will be much harder and more durable.  It is in fact the only native north American tree of the Ebony family.  However it is more of a light tan gray color which I am not sure will look good against the maple.

 - Persimmon _([Diospyros virginiana](https://www.wood-database.com/persimmon/))_

### Headplate
Top layer of Curly Maple with a slice of Walnut sandwiched between.  You will see what I mean...


This is a lot fewer choices to make compared to a hollowbody guitar that has a lot more parts (braces, linings, etc.).
