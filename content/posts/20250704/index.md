Here is the **Super K**, a guitar I completed in the Spring of 2025. 

{{<imgresize super_k.jpg "600x600" "Super K">}}

The inspiration for this comes from a early 1960s Kay Value Leader guitar that I own, which is one of my favorites.  It has a great jazz sound.  The construction is interesting too.  It is semi-hollow with just a single block of wood (spruce?) that runs parallel to the bridge from side to side.  Otherwise hollow.   This gives it a little more acoustic volume that a typical electric, and I play it unplugged most of the time.

My version, The Super K, is constructed the same way, and has the same 24 1/4 inch scale length.  I used nicer woods and a much hotter pickup though.  I think it sounds even better than the Value Leader!

The body shape is roughly based on the Kay Thin Twin Jimmy Reed guitar.


## Electronics

- First knob - Volume.  This is a push-pull switch.  Down is normal master volume. Up bypasses the tone circuit and piezo pickup, for just the Phat cat alone.
- Second knob - Tone.  Also a push-pull.  Down is a 0.015 μF capacitor.  Up is a 0.005 μF capacitor.  The .005 really adds more midrange for a more forceful sound.
- Third knob - Piezo Blend.  This acts as a volume for the piezo pickup only.  It is a push-pull too, and when pulled up turns off the piezo altogether for just the magnetic pickup.

## Construction Photos

Here the secret of the horizontal sound block is revealed.  I put my custom spin on it, by notching out the ends. The thought is that a little less mass towards the edge will help the top resonate more, possibly.  I did not need to angle it so much.

### Notes

- One odd thing about this guitar is that it has no sound holes.  I copied the Value Leader in this respect.  However, I found is sounds quite a bit better (clearer mids, more high end) with the back control plate removed.  It must need _some_ sound hole for good Helmholtz resonance.  The next one will have side sound ports.
- I would like to make my own wood knobs someday.
