This was unplanned, but I decided the headstock needed a backstrap.

{{<imgresize backstrap_glued.jpg "800x800" "Backstrap glued into place">}}

After having added the headplate I noticed two things:

1. The headstock was too thick by about 1/16 inch
2. The headstock had a bit more flex than I would prefer

The extra thickness could have easily been solved by sanding the backside down.  But that would exacerbate the flex problem. I decided to solve both these headstock issues in the following manner:

1. Plane off 1/8 of an inch from the back
2. Lay in some carbon fiber reinforcement
3. Add a 1/16 thick veneer over the back, extending slightly into the neck area (commonly known as a "backstrap")

The result will be a headstock that is 1/16 thinner than before but a lot stiffer.

So this meant going back to the Safe-T-Planer to trim down, slicing out another veneer of walnut, and repeating the glue down process used on the headplate. (The backstrap will only be 1 layer thick.)

## Inlaying Carbon Fiber Bars

The backstrap iteself will add a good deal of stiffness, but I figured why not go the extra mile and add in some carbon fiber to make it even stiffer.  I happened to have a 4 inch piece leftover from a previous guitar that had a shorter neck.

As an aside, here is a good methodology.  I wish I had figured this out and used this method for the carbon fiber bars I have already glued into the neck.  I will know better next time.

First, the bar is CA-glued top-down to a sheet of approx 1/8 thick spruce. I had some offcut from an acoustic guitar top that is perfect.

This is trimmed out so that the top of the bar has a spruce extension strip.

The channel is routed to a depth approx 1/16 deeper than the carbon fiber itself, so that only the spruce extension comes up proud.  (The end of this channel is a little sloppy.  I really should have done all routing before adding the ears.)

Now while gluing, the spruce strip on top provides something for the clamps to press on.

Then the extra spruce is planed off, leaving only a nice wood surface.

This is ideal because the carbon fiber is protected from being scaped, planed, or sanded now.  It should not be cut or worked at all, really, for safety reasons.

### Backstrap Installed

Now with the backstrap glued down, the headstock is the perfect 9/16 thick and it feels MUCH stiffer.

Here I have traced the outline of the headstock template upside down to show approximately where the cutout will be.  Note the rounded area where the headstock meets the neck.  This little rounded section will extend into the neck just past the 0-fret line.  Much of this end will be trimmed off and shaped during neck-carving, but I wanted to get that rounded part pre-shaped at this stage.

NOW the headstock is ready to be trimmed out.
