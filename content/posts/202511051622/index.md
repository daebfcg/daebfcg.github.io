Here are the basic woodworking tools that I use most often.  There are not too many.  I also have some special luthiery-specific tools which I will discuss in a future post.

### Saws

From top to bottom are:

1. Fret slot cutting saw.  This is a pull-stroke doveltail saw, made for Luthier's Mercantile.  I cut all my fret slots with this.
2. Dozouki (black handle)  Very handy Japanese pull-stroke saw made for either cross cut or rip cuts.  I use this little guy all the time for small cuts.
3. Dozouki (bamboo handle)  Also a good Japanese saw, made especially for cross cuts.  I used this a lot when I was cutting doveltail neck joints by hand.
4. Ryoba.  Big bad Japanese pull saw, for doing serious carpentry work.  I use this to cut larger pieces.
 One side of the blade is for rips, the other for cross cuts.
5. Gyoku.  Japanese flush cut saw.

### Chisels

A basic set of paring chisels, plus one extra 3/32 that I got especially for the nut slot on ukuleles.  These are great and I keep them razor sharp.  They are a joy to use.

### Planes

From top to bottom:

1. Number 7. This big guy is for doing jointing work.  That is, getting two long/wide surfaces flat and smooth to be glued together.  Not sure how old it is, probably 100 years old.  Got this one from Richard.
2. Number 5. General all-purpose bench plane that I used to use for jointing before I got the number 7.  This one is a Stanley "war-time" plane, produced in the early 1940s and contains no brass parts.  Got this at a flea market and it was in rough shape.
3. Little "Urko" block plane I got from my Dad's house.  Doesn't look like much, but super useful for getting a rough surface flat.
4. Mini planes.  These are tiny and really useful to me.  They come from India and are made of rosewood.  The flat one is great for trimming braces in a guitar or ukulele, or just doing any really small planning work.  The compass (rounded bottom) is for carving out the dish shape of an archtop guitar top and back. (Someday I will get a Benedetto compass plane that will be a million times better.)

## Measurement

These are pretty self-explanatory, but I will mention the short 6" ruler with the center-finder side.  Super useful little thing from StewMac.

The 18 inch stainless steel Mitutoyo goes down to 64ths, not that I use that feature much.

## Scrapers

{{<imgresize scrapers.jpg "800x800" "scrapers">}}

These cabinet scrapers are just sheets of metal. They were a great discovery to me.  Extremely useful for smoothing out wood.  They act like micro planes.  I use them all the time to prepare surfaces to be glued.

Also shown is the burnishing rod that use used to hone them but putting on a little burr on the edge to make them actually cut.


## Rasps

I mainly use these for carving necks.  The Shinto for rough removal, and the little four-in-hand for finer shaping.
