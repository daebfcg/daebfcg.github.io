### New solid-body electric guitar project

For my next guitar project I'll be building a solid-body electric guitar from scratch.  The inspiration for the design comes partly from the Alembic Further guitar with a neck-through design and curly maple top and back.

I'm building off this basic Strat type guitar design with a couple of customizations.

### Multi Scale
First and foremost is the multi-scale.  It will be 25.5" on the bass side, and 25" on the treble.  This is to retain the rich overtones on the bass notes (i.e. more Fenderish twang), while fattening up the high end with a little less overtone and more fundamental (i.e. getting in to Les Paul territory, but not quite.)  The 25.5" is typical Fender strat, and the 25 is used on PRS and Danelectro guitars.  I could have gone shorter on the treble to get even more fatter/sweeter sound there, but lately I've been liking the feel of the slightly  longer scale lengths.

### Neck Through
I've always said if I build a solid body, it will be a neck through. It just seems to make sense structurally for good sound coupling.  Hopefully it will give it some extra sustain.

### Two Pickups
No "middle" pickup.  The plan is to use 2 Seymour Duncan Quarter Pound Strat pickups, mounted directly to the body.  No pickguard.  (More detail on the electronics coming up later.)

### Body Shape
This is based loosely on a strat, but is more in the 80's "super strat" vein with sharper horns.  I've also narrowed the mid-section a bit, inspired by the early 70's Kay strat knockoff guitars.

### Chambered Body
So it won't actually be a fully solid body. To cut down on weight, as well as give some extra airy resonance, The body will have 2 large empty chambers.  The chamber on the right side will conveniently house the electronics.

### Plans
As with all my guitar builds, I first start with a full-size drawing using Libre Office Draw.  From this, I print out cardstock templates.
