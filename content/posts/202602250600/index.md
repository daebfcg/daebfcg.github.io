Now that the right-side body core section is planed flat and the outline of the guitar body determined, the chamber for the electronics can be hollowed out.  This chamber will accommodate the various pots and switches for volume and tone controls, pickup selector switches, etc.  An opening will be cut into the back plate to work on the controls, and the knob and switch posts will protrude through the top plate.

This planned cutout region should provide ample space for just about any configuration of electronic components I can come up with.

The thin channel going up the inner side is for the wire from the neck pickup.   The wires from the pickups will need small tunnels from their respective routs into the control cavity, but that will be done later once the exact depth and location of the pickup routs is determined.

Next I excavated as much as I could using forstner bits on the drill press.

Then shaped on the spindle sander to get the inside edge smooth.

A similar process will be used on the left half of the body to create a smaller hollow chamber to balance the mass and relieve some of the weight on that side.
