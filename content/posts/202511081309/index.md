In in this step, the headstock is taken down to the final thickness according the the side profile of the template.  The bottom needs to be one inch down from the top face of the neck surface, and the top face cut down to the final thickness.

First, the bottom is cut back on the bandsaw.  This is followed up by planing it flat using the Safe-T-Planer on the drill press.

The top face is also cut back on the bandsaw.

Now the spindle sander with a 3 inch spindle and a fence is used to take it down to the final thickness and also add the radiused corner where the fretboard end meets the headstock.

The final thickness needs to be 9/16 inch for the tuning machines to fit nicely.  However, since I will be adding a headplate which will add 1/8 inch to the thickness, I need to take the headstock down to 7/16.

Some final sanding by hand.  Here the spindle-on-a-dowel trick is being employed.

Ready for the headplate veneers.
