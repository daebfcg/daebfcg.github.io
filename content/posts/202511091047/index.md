Before slicing out a headplate veneer from the curly maple, I decided to make sure I have the body sections successfully roughed out.  Here is the cherry and maple stock for the body.

The maple piece should have enough length for three sections, although I only need two for the left and right "wings" of the body.  Instead of making two generous sections, I decided to try to get three out of it to have an extra in case of mistakes.  This requires careful planning of the sections.  The acrylic template is used to layout the sections to be cut.  This is one of the more critical things to get right because this curly maple is a pretty special board and I do not want to screw it up.

## Resawing

 The maple is 3/4 thick and each section will be sliced to get two approximately 3/8 inch thick slices for the top and back.   This is one the more challenging and nerve-wracking parts of the build, as it is pushing my little bandsaw to the limit. The 4.75 inch width is in fact the maximum height of cut the saw can do.  An unsteady hand or the cut drifting off track and board would be ruined. Thankfully I have a new 1/2 inch WoodSlicer blade and it chugs through the 4.75 inch maple with no trouble at all.

 Always nice to see the bookmatched slices for the first time coming off the saw.

 I am a little annoyed that I did not plan for bookmatching the plates side by side on the finished guitar. But due to the fact the the left and right wings are different lengths, it would have meant resawing the entire board first which I am not sure I could have done. Instead, each bookmatched pair will be a top and back of a wing.  I am not too worried about it though.  It should still look great.  The tiger-stripe figure should really pop once it is sanded smooth.

The cherry board will yield the inner body sections that will be sandwiched between the maple plates.  I will cut out the cherry sections later.

 Since this was a success, I can now use the remaining third section of maple to get my headplate veneer slice and return focus to on the headstock.
