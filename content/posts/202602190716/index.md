The body of this guitar will be comprised of three layers of hardwood - an inner core of cherry sandwiched between two outer layers of maple.  The maple outer sections have already been prepared so now the focus is on the inner cherry layer.

While preparing the cherry board to be a guitar body, I had to change my approach and do quite a bit extra work to get the wood parts into what I consider a suitable state for an instrument.  What follows is the story.

To start with, here was the rough board.

{{<imgresize cherry_board_rough.jpg "600x600" "Rough cherry board to be used the inner body layer">}}

There was some end-checking and cup-warping. This is a very old board. Old wood is good, right?  In my optimism, I believed I could work around these defects.  The cupping should have been a red flag...

After much planing to remove the cup-warp the board was nice and flat and in good shape to be cut out into the two sides for the guitar body.

## then I noticed something...

This board is very flat-sawn, and also has a considerable amount of sap wood (the light area) compared to the heart wood.  This explains why it cupped over the years.  I was very worried that this grain direction and mix of sap and heartwood would be cause for instability in the finished instrument, causing warping, tuning problems, uneven shrinkage, and eventually cracks.

Ideally, quarter sawn wood is used, where the grain runs vertically instead of side to side like in this flat sawn board.  

Waiting for another, more quarter sawn, cherry board this wide to come along would delay this project for years probably.

## New Plan

How to turn a flat sawn board into quarter sawn?  Cut into strips, turn them 90 degrees,  glue together.  This will result in a much more stable structure.  The downside is it is a lot more work.

Fortunately, there was enough wood in the board to achieve this.  To make the guitar shape, not every section needs to be the full length, so some parts of the board can become two or three sections.  I planned out the sections on the computer, lettered each section A-N, cut them out, and started the long process of gluing them up.

{{<imgresize body_sections_strips.jpg "800x800" "The cherry board cut into strips to be glued up">}}

Once all the strips are cut out, I arranged them according to the body template to get the final plan for joining them together.  One good thing is that since the board was already planed flat, the faces to be glues are already mating nicely.

{{<imgresize body_sections_laidout.jpg "600x600" "Checking that the sections will form the correct shape">}}

Notice that the innermost strips are maple.  This was somewhat unplanned, but the maple top and back pieces are just shy of the necessary width, so I plan to have some narrow strips on the inside to widen the neck area just a bit.

Now for the glueing process, which I did over the course of a few weeks, taking advantage of dry weather when it came.  This did require getting some larger clamps.

After some more gluing and planing, the resulting halves are complete.

I also ended up using some strips of walnut on the inside to compensate for lost width due to all the cutting.

{{<imgresize body_inner_layer_with_template.jpg "800x800" "The completed halves of the inner body layer shown with the body template">}}

The next step will be to cut out the chambers for the electronics and weight reduction, then glue on the top and back maple plates, and finally attach the halves to the neck core to form the final body.
