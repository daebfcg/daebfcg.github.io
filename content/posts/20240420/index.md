For my first full size guitar project, I decided to tackle a multi-scale archtop guitar.  This was started in 2019, and after fits and starts was finally playable by the Spring of 2024.

I call it a "prototype" because it was truly an experiment.  The name comes from an invasive shrub that grows all around our house.

Here it is in the rough - unfinished and strung up for the first time.

### Some notable features of this guitar

- Multi-Scale.  25.5 inches bass side, 24 inches treble side, with the 7th fret perpendicular.
- Douglas Fir top, made from a 4x4 post from Home Depot
- Cherry back, sides, and neck
- Persimmon fretboard
- "Nandina" leaf soundholes in the top and side ports
- Jasper dot inlays.  These ended up looking cool on the Persimmon
- Headstock shape of my own design, descended what I used on my cigar box guitars

## Build process
I loosely followed the Benedetto method for construction.  

A major screw-up occurred when I was carving the back plate arch.  As per the methodology, a drill press is used to drill progressively deeper holes into the 1 inch thick plate to form the graduated arch before actually carving.  While doing so, the depth stop on my drill press slipped and I drilled holes all the way through.  So I had to plug these holes and accept the cosmetic flaw.

Note: Solid Spruce linings.

## Top

The top plate was created from joining multiple sections of quarter sawn Douglas Fir boards from the post from Home Depot.  This actually worked out pretty well.  The glue joints blend in well with the quarter-sawn grain lines, so are not too visible.

Douglas Fir actually seems like really good wood for guitar tops.

### Bracing

I tried to keep it fairly minimal.  X-braced.  It seems to have worked out well.

This guitar is currently out under the care of Greg.  I will post more pics of the finished guitar with the electronics installed, knobs on, and French Polish finish applied, at a later date.
