This cool 1960s Kent came around again. It is an unusual hollowbody made in Japan, probably by Teisco.  This time it was buzzing and ratting around the bridge.

Getting to the rattle took some lengthy diagnostics, and I ended up taking it apart to isolate the noise.  I believe the rattles and buzzes were possibly coming from multiple sources.

- The pickup mounting springs (notorious offenders)
- Some wood chips, dust, and debris bouncing around inside
- Screws and roller wheels in the bridge itself

 Note the two bridge-mounting holes.  They are NOT placed at the nominal scale-length location but are about a three-eighths of an inch shy, which is weird.  More on this to come...

## Bridges
This guitar was found by its owner with a wooden archtop guitar bridge which slid around and was generally useless.  Someone put this there probably temporarily to get it semi-playable. Any use of the tremelo would pull the bridge (and loose nut) out way out of alignment.  About 10 years ago I replaced it with a metal roller-type bridge, thinking it would work better with the tremelo.  This was an improvement, but still not ideal since it was a bit too thick and still did not line up with the mounting holes.

Here is the (non)original bridge, and the replacement roller bridge.

A new, more vintage-correct and shallower bridge is needed.  Stay tuned.

## Frets

Aside from a new bridge, what this guitar really needed was a refret.  The first five frets were quite worn and buzzing out.  There was some metal left, and I could have tried to simply level and crown these, but the result might have been frets much too low.  With consent of the owner, the decision was made go all the way and do a full refret.  I happened to have a bunch of 55x110 jumbo fret wire on hand, which should really be a huge improvement in playability.

I have been practicing the semi-hemispherical fret ends, which are shaped prior to pressing the frets in.  I think it makes for a very smooth feel and looks cool, too.  No more sharp edges.

## New Bridge

Thanks to eBay, a "Vintage Japanese style Super Low Profile Chrome Guitar Bridge" can easily be obtained from EZPZ Parts out of Washington state. The metal bushings that came with it are too big for the mounting holes on the guitar, though.  Plus putting the bridge directly over the holes would position the bridge too close to the nut and too short for the scale length of the guitar.  

I will need to fabricate a new base that fits the holes but positions the bridge a bit back from the holes.

Step 1 is to get the bottom surface contour to match the arched top of the guitar.  I have a decent little scrap of rosewood which seems appropriate and fits nicely after some sanding.

{{<imgresize kent_new_bridge_base_2.jpg "800x800" "New bridge base in progress">}}

After reducing the thickness down to where good action will be in range, and adding the mouning posts it is ready for final positioning.  I glued some 7/16 dowel pieces to the bottom which fit into the mounting holes, but positioned forward so the intonation point of the bridge is back where it needs to be.  The metal screw posts are actually at the far back end of the holes in the guitar body, which is about right in this case.

### Scale Length

This guitar has an odd scale length.  It is 640 mm, or 25.19685 inches.  My theory is that the guitar was intended to have a 25 or 25.5 inch scale length, and the bridge mounting holes in the body were drilled accordingly.  But the fretboard uses a zero-fret, which moves (and shortens in this case) the intonation points.  A manufacturing snafu?  Who knows.  I do like having a zero-fret though, which is common on these Japanese guitars.  It makes the action at the nut really easy to get perfect.


New bridge is now in good working order, in the right spot, and stays put.  I like this bridge because it is a low profile, and is adjustable both side to side and up and down.

## New Nut

The nut itself is not super important on a zero-fret guitar, as the main function is only to control the string spacing.  The intonation point and string-height is taken care of the by the zero-fret.  However, this old tusq job is looking rough, a bit shallow, and is not quite spaced right anyway.  Time for a new bone nut.

The new bone nut shined up and spaced correctly looks way classier.

## Pickup Mounting

I replace all pickup mounting springs with lengths of surgical tubing nowadays.  This eliminates the buzzing and rattling and general odd vibrations caused by springs.

Before:

After:

While at it, I also cleaned up some old wiring inside.

## New Year, New Life for Kent
Sounds and plays great now!
