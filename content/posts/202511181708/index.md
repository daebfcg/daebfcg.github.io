Made some progress on the headstock.  The edges were cut out on the bandsaw and disk sanded flat.  Then the neck "flare-outs" shaped on the spindle sander.

Now for the fun part - carving the stair-step edge with a paring chisel.

Fine, hand-worked details like this are what separate one-off artisan-made guitars from what typically comes from a factory.

Still some more to go. The cherry edge on the right needs to be brought in quite a bit to make a smooth point with the other pieces.  Then the tip rounded will be rounded off.  Overall looking good.
