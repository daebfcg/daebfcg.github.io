I like to make a full-size cardstock template of the body first.  This helps with wood stock selection and cutting.   Since this is a solidbody, I will be routing the edges to the final shape, so will also need a routing template.  The routing template will be made from 1/4 inch thick clear acrylic.

I use Libre Office Draw and it has poor tiling capabilities.  So I need to use the following trick to print anything larger than 8.5 x 11.   First export the full size drawing as an SVG file.  This will be the full 40 x 20 inches or whatever.  Then place the SVG on a new 8.5 x 11 document.  Get it back to 100% size and crop to fit on the page.  Move the SVG around and adjust the crop to manually tile and print.

Now to make the routing template, I transfered the cardstock template onto some Ramboard I had leftover from the my kitchen floor project.  This stuff is great for other uses like this.

Then I used spray adhesive to attach it to the 12 x 16 acrylic sheet.  Got two of these from amazon for about $15.

Then I rough cut it out on the bandsaw, and used my spindle sander to get it to the final shape.  A little hand sanding with 240, and it is good to go.

The picture shows it still with the protective layer still attached.  It will be much nicer and clear when that is removed.
