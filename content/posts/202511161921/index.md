Here is a drawing of the planned wiring scheme.  This is not a true schematic, but a simple diagram of the components and their connections. At this point the emphasis is on the switches to make sure the functionality I want will be possible.  So far so good.

This is also not laid out according to where the components will be on the guitar yet.  It is just to get an idea of the circuit and the connections.

For the 2-pole on/on switches, the vertical gray bars represent the connections that get made when switch is thrown.  They are shown in the above diagram in the "Down" position, where the connections are from lugs pins 5 to 6 and 2 to 3.  When in the "Up" position the connections are 5-4 and 1-2.

The on/off/on toggle is going to be interesting. I am planning on using a standard three-position toggle switch like in a Gibson two-pickup guitar.  These switches are actually on/on/on though, and the middle position will place the two pickups in parallel.  I really want these in series, though.  So I may need to use a different kind of switch, or possibly modify the Gibson-type to be on/off/on.  Apparently this is possible with the Switchcraft switches which can be taken apart (since they are assembled with screws) and put back together as on/off/on by flipping the contacts around.
