I am hand-jointing everything with a #7 plane.  Would I like to have a jointer?  Yes.

The #7 plane is a little more work, but when properly honed and used it leaves the surface **dead flat** and very smooth.  It should make for some very tight joints.

I use hot hide glue exclusively.  More on this topic later.

The two screws are used to keep the pieces in place while gluing. They are strategically placed so the hole will be covered up by another part later.

Just to show you what this thing is and how it fits into the overall build, here is the simulated drawing of the full neck-through guitar.  This makes up the "core" of the guitar.

(The core extends all the way up through the headstock, but it is covered up in this drawing.)
