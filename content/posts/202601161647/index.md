Now that I have test-fit the tuners, the headstock can be shaped into the final form.

This just required a little work on the disc sander to get the sides flat and converging to the end.  And finally rounding off the arrow-head to a smooth point.

I applied a wash coat of shellac to seal and protect the wood for the rest of the build process and to start to get an idea of how finished product will look.

The figure of the tiger maple is starting to pop nicely.  This will look nice once it is French polished.
