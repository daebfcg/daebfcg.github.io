The headplate on this guitar will be 1/8 inch thick made up of two layers of 1/16 inch veneers - walnut with curly-maple on top.  The first step is to slice out the veneers.  The curly maple is from the same board as the body of the guitar (recall the extra third section that was fortunately not needed) so should match nicely.

## Thickness Sanding

Next they are sanded down the close to their final thickness on the spindle sander.  

They are approximately  1/8 - 3/16 inch thick now, but need to be 1/16.

I will stop at around .070 or just a bit more than 1/16.

The final thickness comes after some more sanding with a random orbit sander, and then hand sanding. To make this easier, I use double-sided tape to hold them down to a board that is clamped to the bench.

After sanding, they total about 1/8 of an inch which is the target thickness of the headplate.

## Bending

Since this guitar has a radiused end where the fretboard meets the headstock (Fender style) the headplate will be bent to accommodate this curve.  The plates, even though only 1/16 inch thick, are not this flexible at all so will need to be heat-bent to shape first.  

This is done by wetting the veneer with water and then bending over a hot pipe (around 350-400 degrees) to the necessary curve . Then they are held down to where they need to go to dry and cool using the spindle as a mold.   This is basically the same way I bend hollowbody guitar sides, which I can hopefully cover in more detail in the future.

Now they are thicknessed and bent and ready to glue down.

## Gluing

Once correctly positioned, I use two small drill bits in the waste area to index the location and keep it from sliding around during gluing.

Special top and bottom cauls and multiple clamps to apply pressure.  Again, hot hide glue is used for this.

{{<imgresize headplate-gluing.jpg "800x800" "Gluing down a headplate veneer">}}

The walnut layer glued down first.

Then then maple layer glued on top.

## Clean up and trim

To wrap up this stage, the overhang where the fretboard meets the headstock is trimmed back flush to the neck.  This trimmed end will be covered by the end of the fretboard when it is attached later.

Now we can see how the final shape of the headstock will be cut out (note light pencil lines) and where the holes for the tuners will go.  I might make some final adjustments here, but this is pretty close to the final shape.
