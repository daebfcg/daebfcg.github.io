Now that the neck/body core is glued up and planed flat, it is time to determine the layout.  The templates come in handy here to see where the body, neck, and headstock should land.  The key points to mark are the zero-fret, 24-fret, and bridge locations.

I am going to have the truss rod adjustment at the body end of the neck, as opposed to in the headstock.  I think this will make the neck to headstock area more structurally sound since less wood will need to be removed.  Plus I think it will look better with the headplate overlay scheme I have in mind.  Also, I think it might make adjustment easier with strings on.

The truss rod adjustment nut will be hidden under the end of the fretboard and will be accessible by removing a small plate made of either wood or brass that sits between the fretboard end and the neck pickup.

To get the allen wrench in, I am drilling out a little round area just large enough to get the wrench in.  This will be covered up so will not normally be visible.

This round area is drilled out with a forstener bit, and also makes a good place to start the channel route.  

Note - the previous photos show the headstock end on the left side, but in the remaining photos the neck core is flipped around with the body end on the left and headstock on the right (for easier routing).

In addition to a two-way adjustable truss rod, I am also adding two 1/8 x 1/4 carbon fiber bars for extra stiffening.  A stiff neck is a good thing!  I am placing the carbon fiber bars into the same center piece of wood that the truss rod goes in.  My thinking is that when the rod is adjusted the flexing will primarily be in the center piece of wood and pull the side pieces along with it.  Alternatively, if the carbon fiber bars were in the side pieces instead, the sides would have extra resistance to flexing when the center piece is flexed and would stress the glue joint more.

This pinpoint location bit is great for getting the router adjusted perfectly centered along the line I want to route.

Truss rod and carbon fiber bars installed.  The carbon fiber bars can now be glued in.  The truss rod will be removed for now installed permanently later right before the fretboard is glued down.
