Now I can finally determine the exact position of the tuners and the holes in the headstock. I like to do this operation with the actual tuners on hand. All bought parts and hardware should be obtained before starting the build, but I could not wait.</p><img src=/posts/202601111546/sperzel_tuners_hu_2430f645335fff4b.jpg width=452 height=600 alt="New set of black Sperzel tuners"><p>These came directly from Sperzel in Ohio. I really like their locking tuners. I am also a fan of the 12:1 ratio. Most quality tuners are 16:1 or more these days, marketed as being more precise. It is true you can turn them more and get less pitch change which is supposed to make tuning easier. I find that with the high ratio tuners I get annoyed having to turn them so much. I prefer 14:1 or 12:1. They are touchier of course but any guitar player should have no problem using them.</p><p>I also really like their pin-mount system. No screws needed.</p><p>And made in the USA!</p><img src=/posts/202601111546/sperzel_tuner_hu_abcdaa33a8a63aed.jpg width=797 height=600 alt="Sperzel tuner showing mounting pin"><p>The thumbwheel on the back locks the string into the post hole, so no extra wraps are needed.</p><p>As an aside, Sperzel is an odd company to do business with. Their tuners are not available from any retail vendor currently, so they must be purchased either from individuals on eBay or Reverb (usually at a markup) or from Sperzel directly. The nice folks at Sperzel do have a website but no online ordering capability or even reliable email correspondence, so orders must be placed by calling them. And then there is no way to check order status or shipment tracking. This is my second time going through this disconcerting process but both times it has worked out great.</p><p>Getting the positions of the tuners correct took some careful planning and measuring. I mapped out the positions in Libre Office and printed out a cardstock template which I used to mark the locations of the pilot holes for the tuner posts. Then the pin mount holes were located using a little clear acrylic jig I made that ensures all 6 tuners stay in a line and do not end up looking crooked and out of place. (Jigs specially made just for this purpose can be bought for $30-40 but I like doing things the hard, i.e. cheap, way.)</p><img src=/posts/202601111546/tuner_holes_template_hu_7ee2cb8abc0d3d87.jpg width=797 height=600 alt="Positioning the tuner holes with a template">

Then the tuner post holes were drilled out with a 3/8 forstener bit, and reamed ever so slightly to the required 13/32 diameter.</p><img src=/posts/202601111546/tuner_holes_drilled_hu_885c9bb0f6e34ac5.jpg width=797 height=600 alt="Tuner post and pin holes drilled"><p>This was pretty nerve wracking, though. I was worried I would get something out of line.
