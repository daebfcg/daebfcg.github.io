Now I can finally determine the exact position of the tuners and the holes in the headstock. I like to do this operation with the actual tuners on hand. All bought parts and hardware should be obtained before starting the build, but I could not wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601111546/sperzel_tuners_hu_2430f645335fff4b.jpg" width="452" height="600" alt="New set of black Sperzel tuners"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These came directly from Sperzel in Ohio. I really like their locking tuners. I am also a fan of the 12:1 ratio. Most quality tuners are 16:1 or more these days, marketed as being more precise. It is true you can turn them more and get less pitch change which is supposed to make tuning easier. I find that with the high ratio tuners I get annoyed having to turn them so much. I prefer 14:1 or 12:1. They are touchier of course but any guitar player should have no problem using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really like their pin-mount system. No screws needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And made in the USA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601111546/sperzel_tuner_hu_abcdaa33a8a63aed.jpg" width="797" height="600" alt="Sperzel tuner showing mounting pin"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thumbwheel on the back locks the string into the post hole, so no extra wraps are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, Sperzel is an odd company to do business with. Their tuners are not available from any retail vendor currently, so they must be purchased either from individuals on eBay or Reverb (usually at a markup) or from Sperzel directly. The nice folks at Sperzel do have a website but no online ordering capability or even reliable email correspondence, so orders must be placed by calling them. And then there is no way to check order status or shipment tracking. This is my second time going through this disconcerting process but both times it has worked out great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the positions of the tuners correct took some careful planning and measuring. I mapped out the positions in Libre Office and printed out a cardstock template which I used to mark the locations of the pilot holes for the tuner posts. Then the pin mount holes were located using a little clear acrylic jig I made that ensures all 6 tuners stay in a line and do not end up looking crooked and out of place. (Jigs specially made just for this purpose can be bought for $30-40 but I like doing things the hard, i.e. cheap, way.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next a #36 drill bit was used to drill the pin mount holes. Then the tuner post holes were drilled out with a 3/8 forstener bit, and reamed ever so slightly to the required 13/32 diameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was pretty nerve wracking, though. I was worried I would get something out of line. But with a test-fitting, I think it looks pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I know exactly where the tuning machines will be, the final shape of the headstock can be carved out.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kent Rehab</title><link>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601020741/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 13:41:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601020741/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601020741/kent_disassembled_hu_5adbcabdd77bef5c.jpg" width="600" height="452" alt="Kent guitar taken apart"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cool 1960s Kent came around again. It is an unusual hollowbody made in Japan, probably by Teisco. This time it was buzzing and ratting around the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to the rattle took some lengthy diagnostics, and I ended up taking it apart to isolate the noise. I believe the rattles and buzzes were possibly coming from multiple sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pickup mounting springs (notorious offenders)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some wood chips, dust, and debris bouncing around inside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screws and roller wheels in the bridge itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the two bridge-mounting holes. They are NOT placed at the nominal scale-length location but are about a three-eighths of an inch shy, which is weird. More on this to come&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601020741/kent_body_hu_d516ade8b7b179dd.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Kent guitar Body showing bridge holes"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bridges"&gt;Bridges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guitar was found by its owner with a wooden archtop guitar bridge which slid around and was generally useless. Someone put this there probably temporarily to get it semi-playable. Any use of the tremelo would pull the bridge (and loose nut) out way out of alignment. About 10 years ago I replaced it with a metal roller-type bridge, thinking it would work better with the tremelo. This was an improvement, but still not ideal since it was a bit too thick and still did not line up with the mounting holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the (non)original bridge, and the replacement roller bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601020741/kent_bridges_old_hu_8e53a2d0fdd714c8.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Previous bridges used on the Kent"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new, more vintage-correct and shallower bridge is needed. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="frets"&gt;Frets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from a new bridge, what this guitar really needed was a refret. The first five frets were quite worn and buzzing out. There was some metal left, and I could have tried to simply level and crown these, but the result might have been frets much too low. With consent of the owner, the decision was made go all the way and do a full refret. I happened to have a bunch of 55x110 jumbo fret wire on hand, which should really be a huge improvement in playability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601020741/kent_frets_old_hu_419dfc54f1dbf672.jpg" width="602" height="800" alt="Old worn frets"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old frets removed.

&lt;p&gt;New frets installed.

&lt;p&gt;I have been practicing the semi-hemispherical fret ends, which are shaped prior to pressing the frets in. I think it makes for a very smooth feel and looks cool, too. No more sharp edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601020741/kent_frets_new_2_hu_66c101d79270fc8a.jpg" width="602" height="800" alt="New fret ends"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-bridge"&gt;New Bridge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to eBay, a &amp;ldquo;Vintage Japanese style Super Low Profile Chrome Guitar Bridge&amp;rdquo; can easily be obtained from EZPZ Parts out of Washington state. The metal bushings that came with it are too big for the mounting holes on the guitar, though. Plus putting the bridge directly over the holes would position the bridge too close to the nut and too short for the scale length of the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will need to fabricate a new base that fits the holes but positions the bridge a bit back from the holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1 is to get the bottom surface contour to match the arched top of the guitar. I have a decent little scrap of rosewood which seems appropriate and fits nicely after some sanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601020741/kent_new_bridge_base_1_hu_15796554f8302d9f.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Making a new base for the new bridge"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reducing the thickness down to where good action will be in range, and adding the mouning posts it is ready for final positioning. I glued some 7/16 dowel pieces to the bottom which fit into the mounting holes, but positioned forward so the intonation point of the bridge is back where it needs to be. The metal screw posts are actually at the far back end of the holes in the guitar body, which is about right in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601020741/kent_new_bridge_base_done_hu_99fbaba8ec4b109d.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="New bridge base mounted"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="scale-length"&gt;Scale Length&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guitar has an odd scale length. It is 640 mm, or 25.19685 inches. My theory is that the guitar was intended to have a 25 or 25.5 inch scale length, and the bridge mounting holes in the body were drilled accordingly. But the fretboard uses a zero-fret, which moves (and shortens in this case) the intonation points. A manufacturing snafu? Who knows. I do like having a zero-fret though, which is common on these Japanese guitars. It makes the action at the nut really easy to get perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New bridge is now in good working order, in the right spot, and stays put. I like this bridge because it is a low profile, and is adjustable both side to side and up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202601020741/kent_new_bridge_hu_f698ede926ecbee5.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="New bridge on the guitar"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-nut"&gt;New Nut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nut itself is not super important on a zero-fret guitar, as the main function is only to control the string spacing. The intonation point and string-height is taken care of the by the zero-fret. However, this old tusq job is looking rough, a bit shallow, and is not quite spaced right anyway. Time for a new bone nut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new bone nut shined up and spaced correctly looks way classier.

&lt;h2 id="pickup-mounting"&gt;Pickup Mounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replace all pickup mounting springs with lengths of surgical tubing nowadays. This eliminates the buzzing and rattling and general odd vibrations caused by springs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before:

&lt;p&gt;While at it, I also cleaned up some old wiring inside.&lt;/p&gt;

The edges were cut out on the bandsaw and disk sanded flat. Then the neck &amp;ldquo;flare-outs&amp;rdquo; shaped on the spindle sander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the fun part - carving the stair-step edge with a paring chisel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine, hand-worked details like this are what separate one-off artisan-made guitars from what typically comes from a factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511181708/headstock_progress_hu_793d8def533fcc32.jpg" width="602" height="800" alt="The headstock refined"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still some more to go. The cherry edge on the right needs to be brought in quite a bit to make a smooth point with the other pieces. Then the tip rounded will be rounded off. Overall looking good.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Backstrap</title><link>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511171614/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 22:14:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511171614/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This was unplanned, but I decided the headstock needed a backstrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511171614/backstrap_glued_hu_81dbb7432b1ec359.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Backstrap glued into place"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having added the headplate I noticed two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The headstock was too thick by about 1/16 inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The headstock had a bit more flex than I would prefer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra thickness could have easily been solved by sanding the backside down. But that would exacerbate the flex problem. I decided to solve both these headstock issues in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plane off 1/8 of an inch from the back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lay in some carbon fiber reinforcement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a 1/16 thick veneer over the back, extending slightly into the neck area (commonly known as a &amp;ldquo;backstrap&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result will be a headstock that is 1/16 thinner than before but a lot stiffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this meant going back to the Safe-T-Planer to trim down, slicing out another veneer of walnut, and repeating the glue down process used on the headplate. (The backstrap will only be 1 layer thick.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="inlaying-carbon-fiber-bars"&gt;Inlaying Carbon Fiber Bars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backstrap iteself will add a good deal of stiffness, but I figured why not go the extra mile and add in some carbon fiber to make it even stiffer. I happened to have a 4 inch piece leftover from a previous guitar that had a shorter neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, here is a good methodology. I wish I had figured this out and used this method for the carbon fiber bars I have already glued into the neck. I will know better next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the bar is CA-glued top-down to a sheet of approx 1/8 thick spruce. I had some offcut from an acoustic guitar top that is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511171614/cf_prepare_hu_591b1725c5d042ce.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Carbon Fiber rod glued to spruce stock"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is trimmed out so that the top of the bar has a spruce extension strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511171614/cf_topped_hu_d189f030a6c543d6.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Carbon Fiber rod with spruce on top"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channel is routed to a depth approx 1/16 deeper than the carbon fiber itself, so that only the spruce extension comes up proud. (The end of this channel is a little sloppy. I really should have done all routing before adding the ears.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511171614/cf_insert_hu_ff747088e46f0ae7.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Carbon Fiber rod ready to install"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now while gluing, the spruce strip on top provides something for the clamps to press on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511171614/cf_gluing_hu_2234d9eb34fcb82a.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Carbon Fiber rod glued in"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the extra spruce is planed off, leaving only a nice wood surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511171614/cf_planing_hu_a99566edb128d41a.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Planing off the spruce strip"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511171614/headstock_back_hu_f23d9fe3597b37d8.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Back of headstock ready for backstrap"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is ideal because the carbon fiber is protected from being scaped, planed, or sanded now. It should not be cut or worked at all, really, for safety reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="backstrap-installed"&gt;Backstrap Installed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the backstrap glued down, the headstock is the perfect 9/16 thick and it feels MUCH stiffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I have traced the outline of the headstock template upside down to show approximately where the cutout will be. Note the rounded area where the headstock meets the neck. This little rounded section will extend into the neck just past the 0-fret line. Much of this end will be trimmed off and shaped during neck-carving, but I wanted to get that rounded part pre-shaped at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOW the headstock is ready to be trimmed out.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Wiring Diagram</title><link>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511161921/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 01:21:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511161921/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a drawing of the planned wiring scheme. This is not a true schematic, but a simple diagram of the components and their connections. At this point the emphasis is on the switches to make sure the functionality I want will be possible. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also not laid out according to where the components will be on the guitar yet. It is just to get an idea of the circuit and the connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511161921/wiring_hu_ff8a442904962cfe.jpg" width="1440" height="731" alt="proposed wiring diagram"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 2-pole on/on switches, the vertical gray bars represent the connections that get made when switch is thrown. They are shown in the above diagram in the &amp;ldquo;Down&amp;rdquo; position, where the connections are from lugs 5 to 6 and 2 to 3. When in the &amp;ldquo;Up&amp;rdquo; position the connections are 5-4 and 1-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The on/off/on toggle is going to be interesting. I am planning on using a standard three-position toggle switch like in a Gibson two-pickup guitar. These switches are actually on/on/on, and the middle position will place the two pickups in parallel. I really want these in series, though. So I may need to use a different kind of switch, or possibly modify the Gibson-type to be on/off/on. Apparently this is possible with the Switchcraft switches which can be taken apart (since they are assembled with screws) and put back together as on/off/on by flipping the contacts around.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Headplate</title><link>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 00:14:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The headplate on this guitar will be 1/8 inch thick made up of two layers of 1/16 inch veneers - walnut with curly-maple on top. The first step is to slice out the veneers. The curly-maple is from the same board as the body of the guitar (recall the extra third section that was fortunately not needed) so should match nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/headplate-veneers-rough_hu_e682b4de1b4bca19.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Rough cut veneer sheets for the headstock"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thickness-sanding"&gt;Thickness Sanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next they are sanded close to their final thickness on the spindle sander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are approximately 3/16 inch thick now but need to be 1/16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/thinning-before_hu_ef512e66b072d742.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Before thinning"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will stop at around .070 or just a bit more than 1/16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/thinning-after_hu_43044cee70761e64.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="After thinning"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final thickness comes after some more sanding with a random orbit sander, and then hand sanding. To make this easier, I use double-sided tape to hold them down to a board that is clamped to the bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/sanding_hu_7be896e9efd3a9ed.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Hand sanding to final thickness"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sanding, they total about 1/8 of an inch which is the target thickness of the headplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/post-sanding_hu_a9fe9e83554f291f.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Veneer pair sanded to overall final thickness"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bending"&gt;Bending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this guitar has a radiused end where the fretboard meets the headstock (Fender style) the headplate will be bent to accommodate this curve. The plates, even though only 1/16 inch thick, are not this flexible at all so will need to be heat-bent to shape first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is done by wetting the veneer with water and then bending over a hot pipe (around 350-400 degrees) to the necessary curve . Then they are held down to where they need to go to dry and cool using the spindle as a mold. This is basically the same way I bend hollowbody guitar sides, which I can hopefully cover in more detail in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/bending-drying_hu_18bf317ea4043ff5.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Headstock veneers cooling in the mold after bending"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now they are thicknessed and bent and ready to glue down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/headplates-pre-glue_hu_ca0679b4911ce9d5.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Headstock veneers bent and ready to be attached"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gluing"&gt;Gluing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once correctly positioned, I use two small drill bits as index-pins in the waste areas to lock down the location and keep it from sliding around during gluing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/headplate-alignment_hu_bcebbe24d66d0558.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Headplate veneer positioned and indexed"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special top and bottom cauls and multiple clamps to apply pressure. Again, hot hide glue is used for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/headplate-gluing_hu_73b2e2ae8bcd5f4b.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Gluing down a headplate veneer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walnut layer glued down first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/walnut-layer-glued_hu_96f274bb6a4c41c.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Walnut veneer glued"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then then maple layer glued on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/maple-layer-glued_hu_66e9e47be125def3.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Maple veneer glued"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="clean-up-and-trim"&gt;Clean up and trim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up this stage, the overhang where the fretboard meets the headstock is trimmed back flush to the neck. This trimmed end will be covered by the end of the fretboard when it is attached later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/headplate-trimmed_hu_babfe9ad897f5e01.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="Trimming end of headplate"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can see how the final shape of the headstock will be cut out (note light pencil lines) and where the holes for the tuners will go. I might make some final adjustments here, but this is pretty close to the final shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511151814/headstock-outlined_hu_dafc4619a78dea51.jpg" width="452" height="600" alt="Outline of headstock"&gt;</description></item><item><title>Electronics Plan V1</title><link>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511100736/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:36:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511100736/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Some cold weather today so I am staying out of the shop and taking a closer look at the electronics planned for the guitar. Once the guitar is fully assembled and strung up for the first time (before finishing, though) I will see what it sounds like and test out different circuits and components using an external breadboard before drilling the final holes for the potentiometers (pots) and switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="initial-idea"&gt;Initial Idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511100736/electronics-layout-800_hu_fef085444fcc2d45.jpg" width="800" height="772" alt="initial idea for electronics"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pickup-selector-toggle"&gt;Pickup Selector Toggle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Les Paul style &lt;a href="https://www.stewmac.com/electronics/components-and-parts/switches/axlabs-3-way-6-pole-toggle-switch/"&gt;three-position toggle&lt;/a&gt; for the neck pickup, bridge pickup, or both in parallel. Black. I considered other options such as individual on/off switches for each pickup or a Telecaster-style blade pickup, but landed on the toggle with the idea that it is the most fool-proof way to easily flip while playing. The exact placement will be determined once I actually try to play the guitar to see where my hand goes when moving my elbow to get it in just the right spot. I will also angle switch movement so as not to make it &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; easy to flip to avoid accidentally switching it during vigorous strumming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="neck-and-bridge-tap-switches"&gt;Neck and Bridge Tap Switches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will be &lt;a href="https://lovemyswitches.com/taiway-dpdt-on-on-switch-solder-lug-short-shaft-black-plated/"&gt;mini on/on toggle switches&lt;/a&gt; to control the pickup taps. The plan is to use &lt;a href="https://www.seymourduncan.com/single-product/quarter-pound-strat"&gt;Seymour Duncan Quarter Pound Strat&lt;/a&gt; Tapped pickups, which have a normal, modern high-output lead plus an additional tapped lead for a more vintage half-power output. This will allow the player to get two different sounds out of each pickup. I expect the normal (up) position will be more suitable for modern high-gain styles and the tapped (down) will produce more a traditional clean/jangly strat-type sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tone-bypass"&gt;Tone ByPass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mini on/on toggle that will allow bypassing the tone circuit completely. When down, the normal tone and volume signal path is active. When switched up, the tone controls are bypassed and have no effect, so only the volume control is in the circuit. The thinking is that tone controls do attenuate the signal even when turned all the way up, because the resistance of the pots is not infinite and some signal is still getting grounded. Add in the capacitors, and there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; tone being changed even when the tone is on &amp;ldquo;10&amp;rdquo;. So this allows the player to get an even more pure and raw signal from the pickups without any influence by the tone controls. Only the volume control still works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tone-knob-1---bass-cut"&gt;Tone Knob 1 - Bass Cut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit different from a normal single-tone control on a guitar. This guitar will have separate treble and bass controls (passive). This is directly copying the G&amp;amp;L S500 wiring. Most guitars just have a single tone control which attenuates the high frequencies. Here with the additional bass-frequency attenuation, the player will be able to clean up the signal to cut through a mix better by cutting out some bass. This will be a 1MG Ohm audio taper pot, with a small capacitor around 1000 picofarads. When testing the circuit I will determine the best capacitor value. Black, &lt;a href="https://lovemyswitches.com/anodized-aluminum-knob-the-hi-fi-1-4-smooth-shaft-20mm-od/"&gt;20mm aluminum knobs&lt;/a&gt; for the tone controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tone-knob-2---treble-cut"&gt;Tone Knob 2 - Treble Cut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the more traditional tone control that just cuts the high end. I am thinking 500k audio-taper pot, with a .022 microfarad capacitor. Again, will experiment to find a good sounding capacitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="volume"&gt;Volume&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic volume control. 250k linear pot. I prefer linear pots for volume, as opposed to audio-taper. Note the large knob&amp;hellip; I am thinking of using &lt;a href="https://lovemyswitches.com/solid-aluminum-knob-mission-control-1-4-smooth-shaft-32mm-od/"&gt;freakishly large 32mm knob&lt;/a&gt; for the volume to allow the player to easily grab it with their pinky finger while playing to do dramatic volume swells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="direct-out"&gt;Direct Out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last on/on toggle switch near the volume, which will bypass both the volume and tone from the circuit and send the pickup signal directly to the jack. This is for an even more pure, raw signal unaffected by any pots or capacitors. This can act as a mini &amp;ldquo;boost&amp;rdquo; effect during a performance. Used this way, it is sometimes called a blower switch. It might also be useful for recording, where all tone and volume is controlled during mixing and you want the purest and loudest signal to be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jack"&gt;Jack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of trying one of these &lt;a href="https://www.amplifiedparts.com/products/jack-pure-tone-mono-open-circuit"&gt;PureTone&lt;/a&gt; jacks. In black of course to match all the other hardware. The jack will be in the side of guitar, Telecaster style, using a nice &lt;a href="https://www.stewmac.com/parts-and-hardware/jack-plates/electrosocket-jack-mount/"&gt;recessed plate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="breadboarding"&gt;Breadboarding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I usually do is mount the pickups into the guitar and connect the leads to a breadboard tester on my desk, which is then connected to an amp. The allows me to fiddle around with different components and wiring schemes before soldering anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More photos and updates to come on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Body Top and Back Plates</title><link>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511091047/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 16:47:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511091047/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Before slicing out a headplate veneer from the curly maple, I decided to make sure I have the body sections successfully roughed out. Here is the cherry and maple stock for the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511091047/body-stock_hu_c99a6d63aa0dbcfd.jpg" width="452" height="600" alt="body stock"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maple piece should have enough length for three sections, although I only need two for the left and right &amp;ldquo;wings&amp;rdquo; of the body. Instead of making two generous sections, I decided to try to get three out of it to have an extra in case of mistakes. This requires careful planning of the sections. The acrylic template is used to layout the sections to be cut. This is one of the more critical things to get right because this curly maple is a pretty special board and I do not want to screw it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511091047/layout1_hu_ba5515d4c10f0802.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="maple board layout"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="resawing"&gt;Resawing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maple is 3/4 thick and each section will be sliced to get two approximately 3/8 inch thick slices for the top and back. This is one the more challenging and nerve-wracking parts of the build, as it is pushing my little bandsaw to the limit. The 4.75 inch width is in fact the maximum height of cut the saw can do. An unsteady hand or the cut drifting off track and board would be ruined. Thankfully I have a new 1/2 inch WoodSlicer blade and it chugs through the 4.75 inch maple with no trouble at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511091047/resaw1_hu_92b454275af83459.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="resawing maple 1"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511091047/resaw2_hu_806ae647abd08728.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="resawing maple 2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always nice to see the bookmatched slices for the first time coming off the saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511091047/bookmatch1_hu_523b77f608c9e275.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="bookmatching 1"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a little annoyed that I did not plan for bookmatching the plates side by side on the finished guitar. But due to the fact the the left and right wings are different lengths, it would have meant resawing the entire board first which I am not sure I could have done. Instead, each bookmatched pair will be a top and back of a wing. I am not too worried about it though. It should still look great. The tiger-stripe figure should really pop once it is sanded smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511091047/maple-wings_hu_c6a23cc4c45c4fad.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="maple body wings rough cut"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cherry board will yield the inner body sections that will be sandwiched between the maple plates. I will cut out the cherry sections later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was a success, I can now use the remaining third section of maple to get my headplate veneer slice and return focus to the headstock.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Headstock Profile</title><link>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511081309/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 19:09:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511081309/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In this step, the headstock is taken down to the final thickness according the the side profile of the template. The bottom needs to be one inch down from the top face of the neck surface, and the top face cut down to the final thickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511081309/headstock-raw_hu_b9572a9eaab541d9.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="headstock rough"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the bottom is cut back on the bandsaw. This is followed up by planing it flat using the Safe-T-Planer on the drill press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511081309/headstock-back-cut_hu_523240931fd29d4a.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="headstock back cut"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top face is also cut back on the bandsaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511081309/bandsaw_hu_849b3c50e6eee382.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="cutting the top face on the bandsaw"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the spindle sander with a 3 inch spindle and a fence is used to take it down to the final thickness and also add the radiused corner where the fretboard end meets the headstock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511081309/spindle-sander_hu_ebaf06c37946bd8f.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="spindle sander"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final thickness needs to be 9/16 inch for the tuning machines to fit nicely. However, since I will be adding a headplate which will add 1/8 inch to the thickness, I need to take the headstock down to 7/16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511081309/final-profile_hu_9bc2ad988620f3c5.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="final headstoock profile"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some final sanding by hand. Here the spindle-on-a-dowel trick is being employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready for the headplate veneers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Headstock Ears</title><link>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511072359/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 19:19:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511072359/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Time to add the ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the headstock template is wider than the neck, so some wood will need to be added to the sides to accommodate the extra width. The technical term for these additional pieces of wood is the &amp;ldquo;ears&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511072359/headstock1_hu_3b94a04bde888d6b.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="headstock before"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately there is some excess wood at the end which will fit nicely and also match in appearance. Just need to cut those out, flip around, and glue into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://daebfcg.github.io/posts/202511072359/headstock_glued_hu_81bf54d47e28f7f4.jpg" width="800" height="602" alt="headstock glued up"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there is enough width to cut out the headstock shape. I will now be working on getting the headstock mostly done, since trying to do this once the body is attached would be awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
